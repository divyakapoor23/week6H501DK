# Bonus Exercise - Musical Artist Data Collection

This implementation completes all three parts of the optional bonus exercise:

## üìã What's Included

### 1. Artists List (100+ Artists)
- **File**: `artists_list.txt`
- **Content**: 152+ musical artists from various genres and eras
- **Genres Covered**: Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, R&B, Electronic, Indie, Country, Jazz, World Music, Folk
- **Format**: One artist per line, with comments for organization

### 2. Basic Data Collection Script
- **File**: `collect_artist_data.py`
- **Features**:
  - Reads artists from `artists_list.txt`
  - Uses your `Genius.get_artists()` method
  - Saves results to timestamped CSV file
  - Includes progress tracking and error handling
  - Provides detailed statistics

### 3. Multiprocessing Enhanced Script
- **File**: `collect_artist_data_multiprocessing.py`
- **Features**:
  - Parallel processing for faster data collection
  - Intelligent batch sizing based on system resources
  - Progress tracking with real-time updates
  - Performance metrics and speedup calculations
  - Robust error handling for parallel execution

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Your `env-1.env` file with valid `ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Python packages: pandas, requests (automatically handled by your code)

### Option 1: Basic Sequential Processing
```bash
python collect_artist_data.py
```
- **Best for**: Smaller lists, API rate limit concerns
- **Speed**: ~3-5 artists per second
- **Resource usage**: Low

### Option 2: Multiprocessing (Recommended for large lists)
```bash
python collect_artist_data_multiprocessing.py
```
- **Best for**: Large lists, faster completion
- **Speed**: ~10-20 artists per second (depending on system)
- **Resource usage**: Higher CPU and memory

### Option 3: Test First
```bash
python test_bonus_exercise.py
```
- Tests your setup with a small sample
- Provides usage instructions
- Verifies API connectivity

## üìä Output Files

### CSV Columns
- `search_term`: Original artist name from the list
- `artist_name`: Artist name found by Genius API
- `artist_id`: Genius API artist ID
- `followers_count`: Number of followers (if available)

### File Naming
- Basic version: `artist_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- Multiprocessing: `artist_data_multiprocessing_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

## ‚ö° Performance Comparison

| Version | Time Estimate | CPU Usage | API Calls | Best For |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Basic | ~8-15 minutes | Low | Sequential | Small lists, rate limits |
| Multiprocessing | ~3-6 minutes | High | Parallel | Large lists, speed |

## üîß Technical Details

### Multiprocessing Implementation
- Uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for better control
- Dynamic batch sizing based on CPU cores
- Respects API rate limits with controlled concurrency
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Individual artist failures don't stop the entire process
- Detailed error reporting and statistics

### API Considerations
- Built-in delays to respect rate limits
- Handles API response variations
- Fallback values for missing data

## üìà Expected Results

With the 152 artists in the list, you should expect:
- **Success Rate**: 85-95% (depending on API data availability)
- **Processing Time**: 3-15 minutes (depending on method chosen)
- **File Size**: ~15-25KB CSV file
- **Data Quality**: High-quality artist metadata from Genius API

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding More Artists
1. Edit `artists_list.txt`
2. Add one artist name per line
3. Use `#` for comments
4. Run either script

### Adjusting Performance
- **Batch Size**: Modify `batch_size` in multiprocessing script
- **Workers**: Adjust `num_workers` (recommend ‚â§ 4 for API respect)
- **Delays**: Modify sleep times in your `get_artists()` method

## üéØ Assignment Completion

‚úÖ **Part 1**: 152 musical artists saved in `artists_list.txt`  
‚úÖ **Part 2**: Python script using `.get_artists()` method saves to CSV  
‚úÖ **Part 3**: Multiprocessing version for improved performance  

**Bonus Features Added**:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Progress tracking
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Test script for validation
- Detailed documentation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"ACCESS_TOKEN not found"**: Check your `env-1.env` file
2. **"Module not found"**: Ensure all packages are installed
3. **Slow performance**: Try the multiprocessing version
4. **API errors**: Check internet connection and token validity
